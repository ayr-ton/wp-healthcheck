WP Healthcheck is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

== Description ==

[WP Healthcheck](https://wp-healthcheck.com) is a plugin to check the health of your WordPress install.

It collects some useful information regarding your site health, like the number of active transients and autoload options, and then bring them up to you via Dashboard.

Besides that, it also verifies for the version of the softwares installed in your server.

All the information we collect are stored locally in your database, and we do NOT send them to any remote servers.
